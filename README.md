## Project Description

Summitpost website allows users to be able to find hiking trails, gear, connections to other hikers, and plan trips solo or within groups. 

The main purpose of the website is to connect hikers from beginner to experienced with the outdoors, but upon an initial view of the website, the user is hit with information overload.

Crowded and unorganized, the user troubles with finding the information they are initially seeking, therefore, leading to the abandonment of the website

<p align="center">
  How could improving a website layout increase user search activity, find where users get lost, and translate to increased use of sponsored products?
  </p>
  
Redesigning the homepage increases user search activity with the addition of simplistic search bars, discernible navigation, finding where users get lost, and improving the information architecture.

## Research

#### Persona Integration 

Personas were identified resulting in a target audience that desires to use this website to discover their desired route or plan a trip. 

Not only solo, but users were identified as travel groups, family vacations, or groups of hobbyists. The skillset of our target audience ranged from beginner to intermediate.


Current and potential users within this target audience were interested in finding a quick and easy way to shop for gear and hiking-related products while maintaining easy access to their routes or favorited places.

#### Proto Personas

The first part of user research for this project is the development of an **ad-hoc persona**. Each member of the design team was tasked with creating a set of proto personas **believed to be the type of person using this website** now and in the future.

The key point of the proto personas is to **find commonalities between different beliefs** of users while de-prioritizing less likely user instances. The proto personas then serve as a reference point which will be used to develop a cohesive, organized set of developed personas to base the key user groups from.

  </p>
  
 #### Persona Development
 
Personas were then developed to **connect with the types of potential users**. 

Drawn from the proto personas, it became clear to focus on two types of key potential users which are different yet searching for the same goal. Users are particularly interested in finding a reliable source for outdoor activities including camping, hiking, and gear. 

*Examples are shown below.*

  </p>
  
#### Think Out Loud Website Walkthrough

A **"Think out loud"** test was conducted on the preexisting website to understand users' initial reactions and problem areas as they talked through a given scenario and verbally shared thoughts and reactions of each homepage. 

A group of 10 participants was selected to walk through the website speaking freely. Each participant was given one of the following prompts which relates back to possible search queries made by our personas.

*You are looking for a family-friendly tent so that you can go camping next weekend. Where would you find one?*

*You want to go hiking near you. Where could you find local trails and campsites?*

*You are looking to connect with people to meet up with. Where would you be able to find that?*

#### Pain Points

Pain points can be pulled from both the think-out-loud test and the developed personas. We can break the points of frustration down into two distinct categories and visualize which aspects of the current website are not satisfying the goals or needs of the current and potential users.

**MAJOR**

* Search bar confusion
* Undistinguishable categories
* Undesired prevalent information
* Confusing navigation bar
* Information overload

**MINOR**

* Unsure of purchase location
* Unknown how to connect with others
* Lack of map feature

## Ideation

#### Sketches

<p align="center"> 
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33335020/151718964-1aeac28e-65e3-4871-af26-245c525610cd.png">
  </p>

Initial design ideas were brainstormed and sketched to implement solutions to users' pain points and incorporate more usability and user needs.

Ideation sketches allow the team to visualize different layout solutions which ultimately break up the overloaded homepage of the current design.

#### Wireframes

From the initial sketches, wireframes for the homepage were developed.

An **A/B** test was performed to determine which wireframe users were able to use more easily.

<p align="center"> 
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33335020/151719047-729d621f-6fc1-4304-aac8-0b25e25383c8.png">
  </p>

#### Information Architecture

Tree testing was used to test the hypothesis that users will be able to navigate to the desired outcome for a scenario. Users were shown a tree-like sitemap of the navigation unaccompanied by visual elements. 

Users were asked where they would navigate to in order to find something; in this scenario, users were prompted. This testing was completed as a hierarchy pattern to test users of the ability to get from point A to point B within a website; going deeper into the website to find the desired outcome.

**Goal**: this type of testing was desired because simple, discernible navigation and ease of use were key factors that were unclear in the original website design. Tree testing will allow for a clear understanding of how the user chooses their path to the desired outcome.

<p align="center">
  <img width="349" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-30 at 4 44 23 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33335020/151719132-f807358d-7bf3-4320-8a47-ef67b148fc25.png">
  </p>
  
 The scenarios used for IA testing are as follows:
 
* You are planning to travel to Colorado and want to hike Longs Peak. Where would you find more information about that?
* You are looking for a tent so that you can go camping next weekend. Where would you find one?
* You are looking to connect with others who like to camp, but we don't know if anyone in your city is interested, where would you be able to search for someone?

*Results are as follows*

<p align="center">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33335020/151719176-d0fcb282-9409-4262-83ae-f3baade36c0e.png">
  </p>
  
Within the planned information hierarchy (above, scenario 1, 2, 3) scenario 1 was the least successful when trying to find such information. 

This gave a clear understanding this information needed to be presented in a clearer manner for future testing/usability of the website. However, from this test, we can also see improvements within scenarios 2 and 3.

## Prototyping

Once the first version of the prototype was complete, we wanted to evaluate if the design met our researched user needs.
The prototype that was created and tested was not an exact representation of the envisioned system, but it allowed us to gather feedback about the conceptâ€™s important characteristics.

The prototype consisted of a digital interactive prototype of the website using Adobe XD.

![prototype](https://videoapi-muybridge.vimeocdn.com/animated-thumbnails/image/d7dde07c-4372-43e0-a5d8-04bf6190c1ab.gif?ClientID=vimeo-core-prod&Date=1643580860&Signature=261c3a5bc7d98a63623d01a246042c885fee125f)

### Prototype Evaluation

Prototype evaluation took place after initial testing and once the first version of the prototype was complete to evaluate if the design met the researched user needs.

Prototype evaluation was broken up into three distinct tests used to determine the journey the user was taking is the right path. Each test highlights a particular area determined to improve the experience of the user. 

The first two tests relate back to the user research by highlighting key pain points. The third test, using a higher fidelity prototype digs deeper into where the users are spending their time.

#### Semantic Differential

Prototype evaluation consisted of a semantic differential test to collect users' initial attitudes and reactions to the **mid-fidelity homepage, and three expanded pages**. The website content was mapped out to provide users three general yet distinct web pages. 

*The semantic differential testing was conducted on each of the mockups to get a general attitude the users are feeling when visiting each page.*

 </p>

*The results are shown as follows.*

<p align="center">
  <img width="818" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-30 at 5 37 24 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33335020/151720836-adcae650-40b1-48fe-aa13-416aac49b711.png">
  </p>
  
 #### Functional Salience
 
A functional salience test was used to decipher which functions are most important, which then helps to relate back to the user and decide how best to design the content. This type of test is essential because the most important functions in the mind of the users should be front and center, displayed prominently on the website to promote good usability and more than just design.

Participants were instructed to decide and define which aspects of the web pages were most important to them. This test was open-ended in which participants were able to view each mockup and present their most concerned and positive areas. Users were asked to speak openly without hesitation and to think out loud.

*Aquired from mockups:*

* Searched for more ways to connect with others
* Desired more emphasis on top visited places, most searched for places, and photo of the day/moment
* "I like how there are two places to search and they say specifically what for."
* "I wish there was a gear section in the navigation."

These reactions from viewing the mockups gave a clear indication of what users desired most; relating back to the user's pain points. These key aspects were integrated into the final prototype to improve user flow.

Once testing was complete, there is a better understanding of the user's feelings while interacting with the website. The high-fidelity stage of this design process focused on helping users advance into the website.

#### First Click | Hot Spot 

The high-fidelity testing included a first click test to determine if users were able to easily advance into the website to the desired destination. 

It was crucial the redesign promoted usability and advancement to key areas within the website; leading to not only exploration of sponsored sites and products but reliable information regarding camping and hiking gear. Promoting such advancement relates us back to our users by offering a source of information and reliable products.

The first click usability testing included identifying "hot spots" on the prototype after being given a task to plan a trip. Clicks were recorded along with the time spent reaching that click. A first click test was also conducted on the initial website to compare usability between the initial website and redesign.

Users were instructed to search for Pike's Peak in Colorado.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33335020/151721063-ec476424-00df-4611-b430-e02d1b5d19b0.png">
  </p>

Results from this test show that participants' clicks were **sporadic and show low confidence** in where to search for a location.

To specify, the correct area is the upper right-hand corner labeled in the above display as Mountains & Rocks. From there users would have needed to select the drop-down menu and choose areas and locations then into the succeeding search bar. That area only received 20% of initial clicks.

The initial website includes two search bars with one taking an extra step for users to have to choose the correct drop-down selection to bring them to mountain ranges rather than the default of mountains and rocks. **Relating back to our users, discernable navigation is a key objective.**

*Initial redesign first click test results*

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33335020/151721162-24c33b84-0231-419f-9848-a6036d587e08.png">
  </p>

Results from the redesign first click testing show users had **full confidence** in being able to determine where to search for a location. The simplistic search bar in the redesign allowed users to **easily be able to search for a location and find the information they would like to visit.**

*The high fidelity first click test task included one task that was the same for the initial website: search for Pike's Peak in Colorado. Because the mid-fidelity functional salience testing phase concluded users deemed photos and top places were important, a second task was included for the high fidelity testing phase for users to see the top photos of the day.*

## Implementation

### First Iteration

The first implementation of the design includes a homepage where users are able to choose whether they desire to plan a trip and see different locations or if they desire to search for gear. This allows users to be presented immediately with the information they are looking for and the "know-how" to get there.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33335020/151721244-f3ed5797-befd-459c-8903-540738b60d5e.png">
  </p>

### Current Iteration

The current design prototype displays a clean and modern take showcasing what was deemed important to the users and highlights major areas of enhancement and usability from the original website.

Redesigning this website can greatly increase the amount of traffic that stays for longer than 10 seconds and vastly improve return users.

With the duel homepage, users are able to quickly determine where they need to go which in turn lessens their hesitation and frustration.

## Future Concepts

A mobile application, as well as an Apple Watch application, would be essential for users to be able to easily continue browsing on the go. This was an essential final aspect to be included because of the typical persona for this website.

High-frequency users need information presented on this website while traveling to various mountain ranges and locations.
