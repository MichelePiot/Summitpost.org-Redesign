# Summitpost.org-Redesign

**Duration: 3 Weeks**

**Role: User Experience Reseacher and Designer**

How could improving a website layout increase the duration and depth of viewing by users and translate to increased use of sponsored products?

By redesigning the homepage to increase user search activity, finding where users get lost, and improving the information architecture. 

**Research**

Key personas were identified resulting in a target audience that desires to use this website to discover their desired route or plan a trip. Not only solo, but users were identified as travel groups, family vacations, or groups of hobbiests. The skill set of our target audience ranged from beginner to intermediate. 

Current and potential users within this target audience were interested in finding a quick and easy way to shop for gear and hiking related products while maintaining easy access to their routes or favorited places. 

**The Primary Goal**

The redesign offers a duel simplistic layout design as well as continuous mobile application. Users do not need to continuously search the website or store to find gear and still browse to find hiking routes and mountain ranges. This website can offer both desires of our key user groups, which are easily decipherable. This redesign was to rid the user of initial information overload.

**Key Objectives**  

The key points of this redesign was an addition of a map feature so users were able to visualize where their routes were in relation to a mountain range or area of the world. Second, simplistic search bars and discernible navigation were strong key areas that will enhance the usability of the website and promote easy access to user's answers and further expiration of the website including access to the store and sponsored products.

**Low-Fidelity**

The first step in the design process were the initial redesign wireframes created for phase 1 A/B testing. 

![Initial Redesign](https://github.com/MichelePiot/Summitpost.org-Redesign/blob/master/ProjectFiles/Initial%20Redesign%20A_B%20Testing.png)

The initial wireframes break up the information overload of the initial homepage by dividing the most interested sections into their own seperate entities within the front page.

Phase 1 tested the usability and ease of navigation of the initial redesigned homepages.

A "Think out loud" test was conducted for each wireframe to understand users initial reactions and problem areas as they talked through a given scenario and verbally shared thoughts and reactions of each homepage. 

Phase 2 testing included Information Architecture testing to test the hypothesis that users will be able to navigate to a desired outcome for a scenario. This testing was completed as a hierarchy pattern to test users of the ability to get from point A to point B within a website; going deeper into the website to find the desired outcome. 

**Goal:** this type of testing was desired because a simple, discernible navigation and ease of use were key factors that were unclear in the original website design. IA testing will allow for a clear understanding of how the user chose their path to the desired outcome. 

Shown here is the IA that was created for this testing:

![IA Testing](https://github.com/MichelePiot/Summitpost.org-Redesign/blob/master/ProjectFiles/IAtesting.png) 

The prompts used for IA testing are as follows:

* You're traveling to Colorado and want to hike Long's Peak.  Where would you find more information about that?
* You are looking for a tent so that you can go camping next weekend.  Where would you find one?
* You are looking to connect with Joe Smith, but we don't know what city he lives in, where would you be able to search for him?

The results were received as follows:

Within the planned information hierarchy (can be seen above) scenario 1 was the least successful when trying to find such information. This gave a clear understanding this information needed to be presented in a clearer manner for future testing/usability of the website.

**Mid-Fidelity**

The mid-fidelity testing took place after initial testing was completed and consisted of a semantic differential test to collect users initial attitudes and reactions to the mid fidelity homepage, and three expanded pages. The website content was mapped out to provide users three general yet distinct webpages. The homepage with the most positive feedback was carried into the mid level testing.

![Midwireframes](https://github.com/MichelePiot/Summitpost.org-Redesign/blob/master/ProjectFiles/Mid-fidelity%20testing%20wireframes.png)

The semantic differential testing was conducted on each of the mockups above to get a general attitude the users are feeling when visiting each page. 

An example of results are as follows:

After the general attitudes and feelings of the user's were recorded, mid-fidelity testing was pushed to phase 2. Phase 2 testing was to dive deeper into how the users were feeling about the redesigned mockups before presenting the high-fidelity prototype.

For this phase of testing users were asked to partake in a functional salience test where they were instructed to decide and define which aspects of the webpages were most important to them. This test was open-ended in which the users were able to view each mockup and present their most concerned and positive areas within the mockup. Users were asked to speak openly without hesitation and too think out loud. 

The key aspects taken from the users are as follows:

* Displayed confusion on where to click on the presented map
* Desired more emphasis on top visited places, most searched for places, and photo of the day/moment
* "What if instead of top searches it was top visited?"
* "Can I look for other routes in Colorado?"

These key reactions from viewing the mockups gave a clear indication of what users desired most such as variability in routes, improved map function, and a large amount of the users desired more top places that were visited. These key aspects were integrated into the final prototype to improve user flows and desired important aspects within the website. 

Once the mid-fidelity testing was complete, our team was able to better understand the users feelings while interacting with the website. The high-fidelity stage of this design process focused on helping users advance into the website.

**High-Fidelity

The high-fidelity testing included a first click test to determine if users were able to easily advance into the website to a desired destination. It was crucial the redesign promoted usability and advancement to key areas within the website leading to exploration of sponsored sites and products.  

The first click usability testing included identifying "hot spots" on the second page prototype after given a task to plan a trip. Users were instructed to search for Pike's Peak in Colorado.

Their clicks were recorded along with the time spent reaching that click. A first click test was also conducted on the initial website to compare usability between the initial website and redesign. 

The initial website first click test results:

![initial first click](https://github.com/MichelePiot/Summitpost.org-Redesign/blob/master/ProjectFiles/FirstClick%20Initial%20Website.png)

Results from this test show that users' clicks were sporadic and show users were unsure of where to go with low confidence in where to go to search for a location in the correct area (the correct area here is the upper right hand corner to the drop down menu and choose a areas and locations then into the succeeding search bar). The initial website includes two search bars with one taking an extra step for users to have to choose the correct drop down selection to bring them to mountain ranges rather than the default of mountains and rocks. 

The high fidelity prototype first click test results:

![Redesign first click outcomes](https://github.com/MichelePiot/Summitpost.org-Redesign/blob/master/ProjectFiles/FirstClick%20Testing%20Redesign.png)

*Side note: The high fidelity first click test task included one task that was the same for the initial website: search for Pike's Peak in Colorado. Because the mid fidelity functional salience testing phase concluded users deemed photos and top places were important, a second task was included for high fidelity testing phase for users to see the top photos of the day. 

Results from the high fidelity first click testing show users had full confidence in being able to determine where to search for a location. The simplistic search bar in the redesign allowed users to easily be able to search for a location and find the information they would like to visit.

**Results**

The final design prototype includes the homepage where users are able to choose whether they desire to plan a trip and see different locations or if they desire to search for gear. 

A mobile application was also developed for users to be able to easily continue browsing on the go. This was an essential final aspect to be included because of the typical persona for this website. High frequency users need information presented in this website while traveling to various mountain ranges and locations. 

The homepages offers a duel simplistic layout design. Users do not need to search store after store to find gear and still browse to find hiking routes and mountain ranges. This website can offer both desires which are easily decipherable.
