## Project Description

Summitpost website allows users to be able to find hiking trails, gear, connections to other hikers, and plan trips solo or within groups. 

The main purpose of the website is to connect hikers from beginner to experienced with the outdoors, but upon an initial view of the website, the user is hit with information overload.

Crowded and unorganized, the user troubles with finding the information they are initially seeking, therefore, leading to the abandonment of the website

<p align="center">
  How could improving a website layout increase user search activity, find where users get lost, and translate to increased use of sponsored products?
  </p>
  
Redesigning the homepage increases user search activity with the addition of simplistic search bars, discernible navigation, finding where users get lost, and improving the information architecture.

### Desired Outcome 

No longer a trap for users to get lost but a goldmine for hiking enthusiasts translating to further exploration; including access to the store and sponsored products.

## Research

#### Persona Integration 

Personas were identified resulting in a target audience that desires to use this website to discover their desired route or plan a trip. 

Not only solo, but users were identified as travel groups, family vacations, or groups of hobbyists. The skillset of our target audience ranged from beginner to intermediate.


Current and potential users within this target audience were interested in finding a quick and easy way to shop for gear and hiking-related products while maintaining easy access to their routes or favorited places.

#### Proto Personas

The first part of user research for this project is the development of an **ad-hoc persona**. Each member of the design team was tasked with creating a set of proto personas **believed to be the type of person using this website** now and in the future.

The key point of the proto personas is to **find commonalities between different beliefs** of users while de-prioritizing less likely user instances. The proto personas then serve as a reference point which will be used to develop a cohesive, organized set of developed personas to base the key user groups from.

  </p>
  
 #### Persona Development
 
Personas were then developed to **connect with the types of potential users**. 

Drawn from the proto personas, it became clear to focus on two types of key potential users which are different yet searching for the same goal. Users are particularly interested in finding a reliable source for outdoor activities including camping, hiking, and gear. 

*Examples are shown below.*

#### Think Out Loud Website Walkthrough

A **"Think out loud"** test was conducted on the preexisting website to understand users' initial reactions and problem areas as they talked through a given scenario and verbally shared thoughts and reactions of each homepage. 

A group of 10 participants was selected to walk through the website speaking freely. Each participant was given one of the following prompts which relates back to possible search queries made by our personas.

*You are looking for a family-friendly tent so that you can go camping next weekend. Where would you find one?*

*You want to go hiking near you. Where could you find local trails and campsites?*

*You are looking to connect with people to meet up with. Where would you be able to find that?*

#### Pain Points

Pain points can be pulled from both the think-out-loud test and the developed personas. We can break the points of frustration down into two distinct categories and visualize which aspects of the current website are not satisfying the goals or needs of the current and potential users.

**MAJOR**

* Search bar confusion
* Undistinguishable categories
* Undesired prevalent information
* Confusing navigation bar
* Information overload

**MINOR**

* Unsure of purchase location
* Unknown how to connect with others
* Lack of map feature

## Ideation

#### Sketches

  </p>

Initial design ideas were brainstormed and sketched to implement solutions to users' pain points and incorporate more usability and user needs.

Ideation sketches allow the team to visualize different layout solutions which ultimately break up the overloaded homepage of the current design.

#### Wireframes

From the initial sketches, wireframes for the homepage were developed.

An **A/B** test was performed to determine which wireframe users were able to use more easily.

  </p>

#### Information Architecture

Tree testing was used to test the hypothesis that users will be able to navigate to the desired outcome for a scenario. Users were shown a tree-like sitemap of the navigation unaccompanied by visual elements. 

Users were asked where they would navigate to in order to find something; in this scenario, users were prompted. This testing was completed as a hierarchy pattern to test users of the ability to get from point A to point B within a website; going deeper into the website to find the desired outcome.

**Goal**: this type of testing was desired because simple, discernible navigation and ease of use were key factors that were unclear in the original website design. Tree testing will allow for a clear understanding of how the user chooses their path to the desired outcome.

  </p>
  
 The scenarios used for IA testing are as follows:
 
* You are planning to travel to Colorado and want to hike Longs Peak. Where would you find more information about that?
* You are looking for a tent so that you can go camping next weekend. Where would you find one?
* You are looking to connect with others who like to camp, but we don't know if anyone in your city is interested, where would you be able to search for someone?

*Results are as follows*

  </p>
  
Within the planned information hierarchy (above, scenario 1, 2, 3) scenario 1 was the least successful when trying to find such information. 

This gave a clear understanding this information needed to be presented in a clearer manner for future testing/usability of the website. However, from this test, we can also see improvements within scenarios 2 and 3.

## Prototyping

Once the first version of the prototype was complete, we wanted to evaluate if the design met our researched user needs.
The prototype that was created and tested was not an exact representation of the envisioned system, but it allowed us to gather feedback about the conceptâ€™s important characteristics.

The prototype consisted of a digital interactive prototype of the website using Adobe XD.
